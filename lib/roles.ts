/**
 * Single source of truth for staff roles and the per-account access model.
 *
 * There are three roles:
 *  - "admin"     — full access to everything; the only role that can promote/
 *                  demote, delete accounts, and assign per-user access. Admin
 *                  accounts can only be created/edited directly in the database.
 *  - "moderator" — can create regular users and reset their passwords, and has
 *                  whatever section access an admin granted.
 *  - "user"      — has only the section access an admin granted.
 *
 * Non-admin access is stored per-account in the `staff.permissions` jsonb column,
 * shaped as {@link PermissionSet}. Admins bypass it entirely (implicit full access).
